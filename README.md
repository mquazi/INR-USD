# INR-USD 
Time Series Analysis of Indian National Rupee against US Dollar
This repo has all the files needed to execute this project. I have used data from Jan 1994-Dec 2016 for model building and data from Jan 2017-Aug 2018 is used for forecasting. I conducted thorough data analysis and detected strong autocorrelation along with seasonality during government elections in India.
Considered ARIMA, SARIMA, Naive, & Decomposition methods to build models and provided forecasts for future rates. Input files are maindatacsv.csv and forecastdata.csv. moneydata.R is the R script for analysis.
